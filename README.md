# QR_Reader
This is simple QR code reader, I made it for fun .... The  program is written in 2 langauge which is python and C++. The python program using the python version 3.10.0 and the library OpenCV, pyzbar where as the C++ program uses the opencv and its own qr code function. 


# How to Run and use??
1. For the python one, just download the nessary library which is numpy, pyzbar and opencv-python using pip. and Run the code directly using python <file_name>.py

2. For the C++ code. First Install the opencv form this website https://opencv.org/releases/ then extract the zip files and go opencv/sources/x64 path. where there is two files v14 and v15 and each of the files has own bin and lib folder. select the v15 folder and put the bin and lib folder path in the Enviorment variable (This Pc > Advance system setting , for Windows users). after that download cmake from this website https://cmake.org/ and install it and also download visual studio community edition from this website https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ and from visual studio download the c++ desktop development tools. After download all this stuff we are ready to build the cmake file. for cmake file copy the content provided in this repo to the rew file and in the visual studio code press "shift + ctrl + p" for opening the command pallet and from there select the "cmake configation" option and there select the choice of compiler select some thing like x86_x64 one. after that copy the content of cmake file here to the pc cmake file which is automatically created. after that build the c++ program and then run the program.
